# A Vuejs app using Quasar Framework

It's a simple app that I built just to have some introduction to Quasar and to learn how to use a api and also to learn more about VueJs.

The API I used was found in this repo: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis. It's a great source to built some stuffs. 
The one I used to do this is this one: https://github.com/shevabam/breaking-bad-quotes.
